Experiment 5: Subqueries and Views
AIM
To study and implement subqueries and views.

THEORY
Subqueries
A subquery is a query inside another SQL query and is embedded in:

WHERE clause
HAVING clause
FROM clause
Types:

Single-row subquery: Sub queries can also return more than one value. Such results should be made use along with the operators in and any.
Multiple-row subquery: Here more than one subquery is used. These multiple sub queries are combined by means of ‘and’ & ‘or’ keywords.
Correlated subquery: A subquery is evaluated once for the entire parent statement whereas a correlated Sub query is evaluated once per row processed by the parent statement.
Example:

SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees);
Views
A view is a virtual table based on the result of an SQL SELECT query. Create View:

CREATE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name WHERE condition;
Drop View:

DROP VIEW view_name;
Question 1

customer table

name type

customer_id int cust_name text city text grade int salesman_id int
